# Resource


<Image src={kaynak} />


This is the section where the content to be edited is identified.

It contains three options: **Videos**, **URL**, and **URL List**.

## Videos

If we want to perform editing with videos from our computer, we use this option.

Videos are added to a folder, and the folder is defined in the system with this option.


## URL

URL is a feature associated with the **Hit Gun** mode, along with URL List.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It can only be used for YouTube videos.
</Callout>


The link to the YouTube video we want to work with is defined in the system from this section.


## URL List

If we want to process multiple YouTube videos simultaneously, we use URL List.

After adding the links one below the other in a notepad, the notepad is defined in the system.



import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

In Hit Gun mode, there is a sequence of operations for using resources.

</Callout>


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

If URL List is active, the system disregards other options and attempts to operate through URL List.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

If URL List is passive, the operation proceeds based on the URL. If no link is defined in the URL, the Videos option is used.

</Callout>
