# Merge Video

When the **Merge Video** option is enabled, new videos can be integrated into the content to be produced.

It is similar in structure to the Sync feature found in the Hit Gun system.

It has 5 settings: **Duration Setting**, **Main Video Position**, **Main Video Ratio**, **Merged Video Opacity**, and **Use Merged Video Sound**.

## Duration Setting

There are three different duration setting options: **Default**, **Random**, and **Custom**.

### Default

The default duration setting starts the merged video from the 10th second onwards. The main reason for this is that there may be an intro in the merged video.

The merging process starts from the 10th second onwards for direct integration of content.

### Random

The merging process starts from a random duration of the merged video.

For example, if you prefer to use a 40-minute video as the merged video, the merging process starts from different durations of the merged video for each video being worked on.


### Custom Duration

This is the area where you can enter the preferred starting time of the merged video.


import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The custom duration is entered in seconds.
</Callout>


## Main Video Position

Similar to the `Hit Gun/Sync` structure, in the **Merge Video** structure, the main video position can also be adjusted.

Unlike the Sync structure, here there are options for both right and left positions.

This means the main video can be positioned at the top, bottom, left, or right.

## Main Video Ratio

Determines the ratio of the main video within the frame.

By default, it is set to 70%.

## Merged Video Opacity

The opacity setting for the merged video is adjusted here. If you want your video to be transparent, you can enable this setting and adjust the opacity.


## Use Merged Video Sound

By default, the main video sound is included in the created videos.

If you want to use the sound from the merged video, you can enable this setting.
