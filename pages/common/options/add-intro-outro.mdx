This feature can be used to add **intro** and **outro** to vertical videos.

Only image and gif usage are effective.

When entering the option, we are presented with two preferences, **Add Intro** and **Add Outro**.

The working logic of both is the same.

After activating the structure we want to use, by defining the folder where our file (image/gif) is located, the duration of the intro and outro is determined with the Intro Duration/Outro Duration options, and the process is completed.
