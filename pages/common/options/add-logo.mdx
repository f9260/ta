If we want to include our logo in our work, we can do this through the 'Add Logo' option.

When selected, three options will be available: an area to add the logo, logo settings, and logo opacity.

We can add our logo from the section labeled Logo/Watermark (gif/image).

The logo settings are the same as those found in the Image Insert section.

If desired, we can complete the logo integration into our videos by specifying the transparency level of our logo from the Logo Opacity section.
