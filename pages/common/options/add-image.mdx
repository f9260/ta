# Add Image

It is an option where you can add image to your videos.

You can use up to a total of 5 images.

Add the images you want to use in a folder sequentially and define the folder in the system from the Images section.

Select the number of images you want to use from the section labeled Image Count.

Then you can create details from the Image Settings section.



<video autoPlay muted loop controls>
  <source src="/gorselekle.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>



The settings for Width, Height, X, and Y coordinates of the added images are made here.

According to the number of images you have added, you can create settings for each image using the "**::**" expression.

### Example

Let's assume that we want to add 4 images to our project.

We put the 4 images into a folder and defined it in the system.

Then we set the Image Count to 4.

We need to enter the resolution of our images and the desired positions where they should be placed.

Let's create example resolutions and positions.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The order of operations should be: Width, Height, X, Y.
</Callout>

`250,420,50,290`::`400,120,140,80`::`110,270,35,65`::`350,200,45,90`

As a result of these settings, 4 images will be integrated into the video at the desired resolutions and positions.
