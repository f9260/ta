# Output

There are 4 options available in the output tab.

**Output Location** - **Logs Language** - **Remove Metadata** - **Play Result**


## Output Location

This is where we define the folder where we want the generated content to be saved.


## Logs Language

The language preference for the logs we encounter while using the system is set from this section. You can view logs in English or Turkish.


## Remove Metadata

If the system detects metadata in the files, enabling this option will remove these metadata from the generated videos.


## Play Result

If we want the generated content to be played after being saved, we can check this box. This way, you can quickly view the results you've produced.
