# Random

The random method allows for the selection of a random duration from the target video.

For example, let's assume we want to create 9 pieces of content from a 2-hour YouTube video.

### Example

| URL | youtube.com/video-id |
| :----- | :----: |
| How Many |  9   |
| Video Duration/Fixed | 30 |
| Method | Random  |


After the above settings, 9 random start times are determined within the 2-hour video, and 30-second content pieces are created.


### Result

| Video | Start | End |
| :-----: | :----: | :----: | 
| 1 | 14:36 | 15:06 |
| 2 | 25:13 | 25:43 |
| 3 | 29:42 | 30:12 |
| 4 | 43:17 | 43:47 |
| 5 | 1:11:24 | 1:11:54 |
| 6 | 1:32:19 | 1:32:49 |
| 7 | 1:43:05 | 1:43:35 |
| 8 | 1:51:44 | 1:51:14 |
| 9 | 1:55:32 | 1:56:02 |


9 videos are created separately in the time intervals listed in the table and saved to the designated folder in **mp4** format.
