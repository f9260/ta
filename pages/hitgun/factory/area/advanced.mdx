# Advanced

The advanced area is a more complex structure.

In all other options, the images taken from the target video start from the top and go down to the bottom. Ratios are created only for the right and left areas.

For example, at a value of 38%, the 31% areas on the right and left of the video are ignored and not visible in the saved mp4 file.

The Advanced option allows us to manipulate the entire target video.

We can save any frame we want.

When the **Advanced** option is active, two types of **Advanced Area Type** appear: **Percent** and **Pixel**.

## Custom Area Type: Percent

This is where we select the portion of the target video we want to capture using percentage expressions.

Its greatest benefit is eliminating the need for resolution calculation.

As it is known, the resolution of each video can be different. Therefore, working based on "fixed values" especially in projects involving many different target videos can create problems.

To minimize these problems, conducting operations with percentage expressions will lead to more accurate results.

When the percentage option is checked, the **Custom Area Percent** option appears.

The sequence here is: **Top**, **Bottom**, **Left**, **Right**.

According to the area we want to select, we write our percentage ratios from the top, bottom, left, and right, and the remaining part becomes the area we will save.


## Custom Area Type: Pixel

Allows the selection of the area to be captured from the target video using pixels.

When checked, the **Custom Area Pixel** option appears on the screen.

Here, **Width**, **Height**, **X Coord**, and **Y Coord** values ​​must be entered in order.

The entered width and height values specify the width and height of the area to be selected in the target video. The X and Y values ​​are the coordinates where this area is located.
