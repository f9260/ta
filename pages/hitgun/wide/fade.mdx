# Fade

The Fade feature allows you to add a fading effect at the beginning and end of your videos.

For example, with a fade set to 3 seconds for the beginning, the video image starts out dark and brightens at 3 seconds.

If you set 3 seconds for the end of the video, the image will gradually fade to black 3 seconds before the end of the video.
